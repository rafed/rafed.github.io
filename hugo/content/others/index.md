## Music

Music has been a part of my life for a very long time. I studied singing in Chayanaut for a few years. Later, I picked up the keyboard and it has been about 10 years since I've been playing the keyboard. I was offered to play in bands but I declined and kept playing limited to a hobby for myself. However, I did play and sing in events of my department. Check them out at our official [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8EQjl_yJh7MCHV7p7SCk0g). You can also see my personal youtube channel [Rafulu Music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm06Y0e-rYROhZ76-GLtYTQ).

## Martial Arts

I learned Judo and Karate.
