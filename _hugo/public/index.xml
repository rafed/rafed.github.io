      <description>Music I&amp;rsquo;ve been with music for a long time. I was home schooled in Rabindra Sangit and Nazrul Geeti for about 5 years. Later I joined Chayanaut. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t continue for long and had to dropout after 3 years. After this I picked up the keyboard and self taught myself. It has been more than 10 years since then. Although I was offered to play in bands, I declined and kept playing limited as a hobby for myself.</description>

      <description>Skills In an interview I&amp;rsquo;d say that I&amp;rsquo;m a backend guy. However, I consider myself a generalist. I like to see the big picture of things and try to learn a bit of everything. That&amp;rsquo;s why I spend most of my time in learning other skills such as cloud, devops, machine learning, front end frameworks.
Backend  Python: Nearly all my projects are done in python. I&amp;rsquo;m good with Flask and currently learning Django.</description>
