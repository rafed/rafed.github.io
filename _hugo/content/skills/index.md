## Skills

I'd tell most people that I'm a backend engineer. However, I like to see the big picture of things and that's why I spend most of my time in learning other skills such as cloud, devops, machine learning.

### Backend

- **Python:** Nearly all my projects are done in python. I'm good with Flask and currently learning Django.
- **Go:** I'm learning how to make scalable applications using Go.
- **Dotnet core:** Not an expert, but can get the job done.
- **Databases:** MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB

### Frontend

I don't like front end development and don't expect me to be a frontend dev. But I do know some good practices for better software maintenance.

- **Vue:** I love this framework 
- **Angular:** Not my favorite, but can get the job done.
- **Flutter:** Don't know this yet but I'm learning.

### Cloud

- **Docker:** Running dockerized containers, setting up clusters
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** I can setup VPSes and know how other cloud services can be used.

### Security

I have spent a decent amount of time in learning security concepts, how to exploit, and how to fix them. These concepts also provided gave me a decent knowledge of networking. I've spent several years using Kali Linux as my main OS. Among the vast number of tools, some of the popular ones I can use are:
- BurpSuite
- SQLmap
- Bettercap

### Machine learning

I have spent a good time using the following tools for building models and data analysis

- Scikit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Tensorflow (Keras)

## Projects

### Competition Projects

- Virtual Trial Room: A web based trial room that can fit dresses on a person standing in front of a camera. This project won multiple prizes and got featured on [BBC Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpd7cbYMJns&list=PLzU2sL8m-hnY65dEuAu-o4NkydCxiBtp_). - 2018

- Showme: A web app that parses research papers and shows a citation graph. It was made for the SCORE competition in ICSE 2018 and it made to the top six. (Python, Flask, Angular)

### Academic Projects

- ScanF: An easy to use web based SQLi and XSS discovery tool. (Python, Vue)

- Syncer: A file syncing software that can sync files on multiple pcs over the internet. (Java)

- Hostman: A console based packet analyzer for Linux (similar to wireshark). (C)
