In an interview I'd say that I'm a backend guy. However, I consider myself a generalist. I like to see the big picture of things and try to learn a bit of everything.  That's why I spend most of my time in learning other skills such as cloud, devops, machine learning, front end frameworks.

## Backend

- **Python:** Nearly all my projects are done in python. I'm good with Flask and currently learning Django.
- **Go:** I'm learning how to make scalable applications using Go.
- **Dotnet core:** Not an expert, but can get the job done.
- **Node.js:** Baby steps.
- **Databases:** MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB.

## Frontend

I'm not a front end dev and don't expect me to be one. But I do have some tricks up my sleeve. 

- **Vue:** I love this framework .
- **Angular:** Not my favorite, but can get the job done.
- **Flutter:** Don't know this yet but I'm conidering it for learning.

## Cloud

- **Docker:** Can containerize applicationsRunning dockerized containers, setting up clusters.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** I can setup VPSes and know how other GCP services can be used.

## Network & Security

I have spent a decent amount of time in learning security concepts, how to exploit, and how to fix them. These concepts also provided gave me a decent knowledge of networking. I've spent several years using Kali Linux as my main OS just to practise a bit now and then. Among the vast number of tools, some of the popular ones I can use are:
- BurpSuite
- SQLmap
- Bettercap
- Wireshark
- nmap
- Metasploit

## Machine learning

I have spent a good time using the following tools for building models and data analysis:

- Scikit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Keras

## Programming Languages
