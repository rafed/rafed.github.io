## Music

I've been with music for a long time. I was home schooled in Rabindra Sangit and Nazrul Geeti for about 5 years. Later I joined Chayanaut. But I couldn't continue for long and had to dropout after 3 years. After this I picked up the keyboard and self taught myself. It has been more than 10 years since then. Although I was offered to play in bands, I declined and kept playing limited as a hobby for myself. However, I did play and sing in most events of my department. Check them out at our official [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8EQjl_yJh7MCHV7p7SCk0g). You can also check out my personal youtube channel [Rafulu Music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm06Y0e-rYROhZ76-GLtYTQ).
