## Best online protoyping tool

<a href="https://draw.io" target="_blank"><img class="pic" alt="draw.io logo" src="/img/blog/drawio/drawio.png"></a>

If you're looking for a free and awesome protoyping/wireframing/mockup UI tool, search no more, go to [draw.io](https://draw.io){:target="_blank"}

Now, there are a lot of protoyping tools available online but most of them are very annoying. Either they are paid or requires signing up. And the most annoying are the ones where you've finally drawn something and then they say you need to sign up to download the image. :rage: :rage: :rage:

Draw.io is the tool that works best for me. Here's why:
1. No registration.
2. Unlimited free usage.
3. Collaboration - you can edit a single image with multiple users in real time, without any conflict.
4. Save images in the cloud. Even the slightest changes made to an existing file will be automatically saved. The following are currently supported.

5. Very simple and intuitive UI.

6. It has many default templates to choose from. Its easier to try them out instead of making explanations. Currently the following notable drawings are supported along with many others.
    * Charts
    * Engineering
    * Flowcharts
    * Networks
    * Software
    * Tables
    * UML

7. It's open sourced. You can see the codes that made this at [github.com/jgraph/drawio](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).

Here are some stuff that I made with draw.io for a classroom projects. Everything has been made just by dragging and dropping shapes from the rich library of shapes that draw.io offers.

<div class="picwrapper">
    <figure>
        <img class="pic" alt="draw.io demo example" src="/img/blog/drawio/demo1.png">  
        <figcaption><b>Simple swimlane diagram</b></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<br>
<div class="picwrapper">
    <figure>
        <img class="pic" alt="draw.io demo example" src="/img/blog/drawio/demo2.png">  
        <figcaption><b>Cool UML diagram</b></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<br>
<div class="picwrapper">
    <figure>
        <img class="pic" alt="draw.io demo example" src="/img/blog/drawio/demo3.png">  
        <figcaption><b>Awesome webpage design</b></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<br>

Note that, not all shapes are visible in the left sidebar. There are much much more! Just search for what you want in the search bar and you'll get tons of shapes that will suit your needs. For example, the webpage designed above was made using bootstrap elements. Just search "bootstrap + the element you need" and you'll get bootstrap elements. Search for "browser" and you'll get the browser frame to put the webpage in.

Get over those clickjacking websites and draw with draw.io! :smile:
