## How many programming languages should I learn

<img class="pic" alt="Programming is difficult" src="/img/blog/prog-languages.png">

Has it ever occured to you, that you see a new programming language and you feel an urge to learn it? With so many programming languages on the block today, it is very tempting to learn a new one so that you don't feel you're missing out. There's so many machine learning stuff in Python, let's learn Python! Kotlin is an official language for Android now, Let's learn Kotlin! Statistics and data mining is so cool with R, Let's learn R! The list can go on. But how many languages do you actually need to learn?

Every language out there has its own advantages that make it worth learning. But here's what you should really keep in mind before starting out a new language that is <mark>goal-based learning.</mark>

You should focus on the goal you'd like to achieve not the language itself. Just knowing a language wouldn't really benefit you. After all, it is just a tool and having a tool is useless unless you're using it. Also, a tool not being used will get rusty and you'll forget the language on which you have wasted so many hours.

Ask yourself, what is the purpose of learning a language? If you have a specific answer go for it. If not, continue with a language you already know.

It has been quite a while since **Rust** came out. It has got a **C** vibe to it and I felt like I should learn it. But then I thought, I'm not really a system level programmer and nor do I intend to be one in the future. So it's not worth for me to get into it.

When I started out machine learning I discovered some wonderful **Python** libraries that makes machine learning easy and fun. I mostly use Java, but the Pythonic way of machine learning is really cool. This is when I realized I should learn Python. I have a specific goal with it. It helps me learn machine learning algorithms and scientific computations in a very easy way. 

So, its basically, learn programming languages as the need arises. Don’t learn them for the sake of learning. You’d be wasting your time and energy.

Sometimes, knowing a lot of languages could be a goal. If you're into security then knowing a lot of languages is definitely a plus point. Project managers need to know several languages because he supervises several teams that could be working in different languages. But you don't need to put extra effort for that. If you're into development, as the years go by, you'll be automatically picking up new languages.
