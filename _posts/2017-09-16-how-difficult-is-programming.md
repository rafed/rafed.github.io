## How difficult is programming

<img class="pic" alt="Programming is difficult" src="/img/blog/programming-difficult.png">

The million dollar question asked by beginners who want to learn to code, "How difficult is it to program?" Answer in short, **learning a programming language is easy. Writing a good program is difficult**.

Think about it this way. You know English, but are you a good writer? To be a good writer you'll need years of practice and dedication before you can actually write something that will be appreciated by all. Not everyone can produce something like _Harry Potter_ or _The Lord of the Rings_. Knowing English and writing a literature are two very different things.

It is no different in the software world. Learning a programming language is very easy. You can learn a programming language very well in a matter of 3 months (you need patience though :trollface:). But learning how to write a good program can take years to learn. There are so many things to know and concepts to grasp that are needed to make a good program. Not everyone can make something like _Google_ or _Facebook_. Knowing how to write code and being a good developer are two very different things.

How much difficulty you'll face learning programming really depends on how far you actually want to go. If you want to have fun writing a few small programs or simple mobile applications, it is easy and you should go for it! If you want to make something big and powerful, associating a lot of users, then things might get a little challenging. Challenges in life might be difficult but they are the most rewarding. There's no reason this challenge should not be enjoyable! Games are only enjoyable when the levels get harder.

So, if you want to be a hobbyist programmer, learn to code, it's easy! If you want to be a professional programmer, learn to code, it's fun! Don't stop the coding! :smiley:
