## How to be a hacker with Kali

If you are asking a question similar to the title of this article, you're probably walking in the wrong direction. Kali is not a magic pill that hacks everything. It is just an operating system that comes with preinstalled _pentesting tools_. Now, you really cannot expect a tool to do everything by itself. You need to understand when it works, where it works and how it works.

Think of it like this, a pen is a tool for writing. A kid scribbling with it won't make any writing. At first, he needs to learn how the alphabets look. Once he learns the alphabets he will learn to draw them. And after lots of practice, we can say that he will be able to write.

The tools in Kali are no different. There are so many things you need to learn before you can actually use them for a reason. Operating systems, networks, protocols, programming languages, algorithms and a _LOT_ of other concepts. Only after you know about these you can start playing with the preinstalled tools. After you have practiced enough with these tools you can hack. 

Know that knowledge required for hacking takes a significant amount of time to learn (unless you're some kind of freaking prodigy). There is no shortcut, no easy way. The common people have redefined the term hacker to be a bad person. But **hackers are actually people who just sit in a place for hours and learn a craft by testing and exploring.** Kali may help you along the way, but it won't take you there. The tools are there to only help you but you have to do the real thing by yourself.

Moreover, you should keep in mind that Kali is not a hacker's tool, it is a pentester's tool (hackers favorite though :stuck_out_tongue:). The difference is that a hacker uses it to exploit a system and a pentester finds a vulnerability in a system to fix it. If you are aspiring to be a hacker using Kali, you just might not be walking in the right direction.

So, in short, what I'm saying is that- learn. Learn programming, networking and the things that can take you where you want to be. It may be time consuming but it is the only way. Do not think of indulging in illegal activities getting into hacktivism. Rather, aspire to be a pentester who fixes systems.
