Choosing the best martial art for you to learn can be difficult when you don't know the differences between them and especially when you have options to choose from. Here goes a short review on which martial art you should learn.

The best martial art gym you can choose is the one closest to your home. Most people that start learning, gradually lose interest and stops going. And you know, any martial art is like hot water. You need to continuously heat it to keep it from getting cold. No matter how good you get, if you stop practicing, your skills will deteriorate. The closer your gym is from your home, the less likely you are to miss practices. In this way, you'll make the most out of learning a martial art despite whichever art you learn. If you still decide on something else keep on reading.

If you are a heavy person, don't like to move around very much and would like to play with strength, go for **Judo**. Judo is all about throwing and grappling. There is no kicking or punching. You'll enjoy throwing people around. If you are interested in grappling more than throws then you can consider **Jujutsu**. Originating in Japan, Judo and Jujutsu are very similar. It's just, Judo is more involved with throws and Jujutsu is more involved with ground grappling.

Are you a self-defense maniac? Then **Krav Maga** is just for you. Designed in Israel, it was made with only one intent- survive at any cost. Krav Maga can teach self-defense better than any other martial art. Focusing on attacking weak points and being able to withstand blows to the body, Krav Maga will make you a survival machine.

Do you want to know about all the ways you can kick? Then **Taekwondo** is just for you. From roundhouses to 900-degree spinning kicks, you'll discover everything you can do with your legs. This Korean martial art will make your legs very strong and you can practically fly with those legs.

Are you interested in only punching? Then consider **boxing**. Boxing focuses in only punching and dodging them. Don't take boxing lightly. Just take a look at some knockouts on YouTube and you'll see what I mean.

If you would like to devote yourself to martial arts for a lifetime then go for **Kung Fu**.  This Chinese martial art is all about meditating and bringing out the inner strengths inside. However, Kung Fu isn't practical if you cannot put a lot of time and effort in it. You could try some modern variants of Kung Fu like **Wing Chun** and **Sanda**. Wing Chun is mostly about punching and it was a martial art that **Bruce Lee** learned. Sanda is a completely modern form of Kung Fu and is best suited for people who cannot devote enough time to traditional Kung Fu.

If you have interests in dancing then you should definitely try **Capoeira**. Capoeira is an African martial art that has its root in traditional dancing. Capoeira is an art that is both beautiful and deadly at the same time. Although Taekwondo artists practices kicking all the time, Capoeiristas can deliver deadlier kicks. They also develop huge upper body strength as well with all those hand stands they do.

If you are looking for something all round then go for **Karate**. Karate focuses equally on punches and kicks. This Japanese martial art is one of the easiest to learn and very friendly for beginners.

Karate is a bit soft (at least in most gyms). If you'd like something harder, go for **Muay Thai**. This Thai martial art, along with punches and kicks also specializes in elbow and knee strikes. Muay Thai is one of the best kickboxing martial art.

Thatâ€™s all about the major martial arts practiced around the world. Pick the best one suited for you and keep on practicing! :smiley:
