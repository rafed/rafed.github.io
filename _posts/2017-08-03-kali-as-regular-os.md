## Kali as a regular operating system

Kali Linux comes with hundreds of pre-installed pentesting tools. If you are an aspiring pentester you will definitely want use Kali Linux and make it your primary OS. Shifting to a completely new OS is a daunting task especially when you worry whether you can do your regular work. It has been quite a while since I am using Kali as my primary OS and I'm here to share my experience with you.

If you are shifting from a Windows environment and have no prior experience with Linux operating systems it is better you stay where you are. Try some other beginner friendly Linux distributions like **Ubuntu** or **Mint** before using Kali.

If you are moving from Ubuntu or any other Linux environments (more specifically, from Debian derivates) you will find almost no differences between them. Kali is a Debian derivative. You can do absolutely anything on Kali that you can do on Ubuntu. In some cases, it is even better. Here is why:
1. The latest version of Kali is a **rolling** edition. Rolling means, updates are provided very frequently. This feature makes sure that you always have the latest software.
2. The user interface of Kali is very beautiful. Almost anyone who looks at my PC asks what OS I run and tells that it is very beautiful. You can have multiple workspaces and assign key combinations to direct terminal commands.
3. The Bash shipped with Kali is the latest version. The latest version of Bash is very friendly to the eye because it now shows color-coded messages. This makes reading extremely easy. It is especially helpful for me when I'm getting compilation errors or when I need to search through a dirty pile of text. Although this version of Bash will be shipped with other Linux distros soon, what I’m trying to say is that you’ll always be the first person to use the latest stuff like this!
4. Most other Linux distributions that I have seen come with 1 GUI environment (X-window) and 6 virtual consoles. With Kali, you can have 2 GUI environment. (If you do not understand this, try pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1-F6 and do not get scared :stuck_out_tongue: you will get virtual consoles.) This is extremely helpful. You can be a GUI user both as a root and a non root at the same time!
5. You do not need additional software for taking screenshots and recording your desktop as a video. It comes built-in.

Kali never limited my working scope. I can do absolutely anything on it. I have had several IDE's installed on it- Eclipse, PyCharm, IntelliJ, CodeBlocks, Android studio and never had any issues during installation or after installing it. I sometimes do image editing with GIMP and Inkscape. I also use Virtualbox to run other operating systems virtually and everything works just fine.

There are some minor issues with Kali that I can tell. Kali is not as stable as Ubuntu. I'm not saying that it is unstable, but Ubuntu has a slightly better performance. I had to deal with some minor bugs not worth mentioning. The one thing that annoyed me is the Firefox ESR browser that comes as the default. I think it has a memory leak or something because after 3 or 4 hrs my PC feeds up on RAM and I have to close and open it again. You can, of course, reinstall the normal version of Firefox to get around this.

Because of a rolling edition, you might be tempted to upgrade your system very frequently, but it is not wise to do so. Sometimes the upgrades are buggy and break the software. Due to this, I recommend not to update very frequently. Once in 2 months should be good enough.

Overall, I have a pretty good experience with Kali Linux as my main OS. If you are aiming to be a pentester but in a doubt whether you should switch OS or not, I would definitely recommend you to make the move. :grinning:
