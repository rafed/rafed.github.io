Design a function that will periodically run on the cached information and make pairs (rider, driver) based on their shortest linear distance. Open a socket.io bidirectional communication medium and send messages through the /communication namespace. Messages from the server will be sent to the client through this channel. Send the ride fare to the client (linear distance * 2 taka) (through socket.io) /rating endpoint receives a random rating after the bot receives a fare  Database  The database only stores driver ratings Storing other information is not necessary (yet) Use mysql or mongodb as your database  Other instructions  You may use any programming language. However, Node.js or Python or Go is recommended Frameworks/libraries can be used. However, it\u0026rsquo;s best not to use full-fledged frameworks. Simpler frameworks (like express/flask/gin) will make things easier Don\u0026rsquo;t implement extra features. Because later, distributing them in multiple instances could turn out to be a problem  Step 2: Service into microservices If you have completed step 1, congratulations! By now you have learned how to-\n make APIs and call them make sockets for bidirectional communication make schedulers that call a function periodically integrate database with an application  If you have done all that, kudos to you! You are now ready to start building microservices (or more like breaking an app into microservices).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s recap what modules we have in our backend system so far:\n a rider module a driver module a rider/driver matching module a rating module connecting to a database a communication module for bidirectional communication  We\u0026rsquo;ll make each of these a separate microservice. Our system architecture will be like the following.\nArchitecture graph TD A --- C[\u0026quot;Communication service (socket.io)\u0026quot;] A[\u0026quot;Client (Bot)\u0026quot;]--\u0026gt;B[\u0026quot;Load balancer (Nginx)\u0026quot;] B--\u0026gt;RiM[Rider service] B--\u0026gt;DiM[Driver service] B--\u0026gt;Ra[Rating service] Ra--\u0026gt;D[(Database)] RiM--\u0026gt;M[Matching service] DiM--\u0026gt;M[Matching service] M--\u0026gt;C  Step 3: Containerize and orchestrate Step 4: Geo distribute the app ","date":1612656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612656000,"objectID":"fcb92ef195efa0ad42f2b4c0ac2aeb4b","permalink":"https://rafed.github.io/courses/distributed-systems/lab/microservices/","publishdate":"2021-02-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/distributed-systems/lab/microservices/","section":"courses","summary":"Goal Your task is to build a distributed web system following the microservice architecture.

In this work, we investigate how well the Bangladeshi software and IT-related undergraduate education prepares the students for the software industry. We conducted semi-structured interviews of twenty practitioners from the Bangladeshi software industry. During the interviews, these practitioners provided commentary on where they believe the undergraduate education system falls short, and provided their suggestions for improvement. Based on the themes discovered from the interviews, we created a survey where more than two hundred practitioners participated. The results of our work suggest that most of the practitioners believe that, while some aspects of the undergraduate education are fine, the undergraduate education system leaves its graduates largely unprepared for the software industry. In this paper, we summarize and present the practitioners' opinions on some key areas including but not limited to updating of syllabi, internships as part of the curricula, the nature, length and evaluation process of undergraduate projects, pedagogical issues, and academic practices.","tags":null,"title":"How Well Does Undergraduate Education Prepare Software Engineers?

Various tools exist that can detect God Class of Java or C++ programs, however, there is no existing tool for detecting God Class(Structure) in Golang. Although Golang is not an object-oriented language, it offers structures which are similar to classes in OOP as they can contain fields and methods. Unlike OOP, methods of a structure can be defined on any file in the package of Golang. This paper presents a tool entitled GodExpo to detect God Structures in Golang programs by calculating metrics namely Weighted Method Count, Tight Class Cohesion, and Access to Foreign Data. In addition, GodExpo can provide version wise results to observe the evolution of God structures. To evaluate GodExpo, an experiment has been conducted on several versions of two open source Golang projects and the tool successfully found God structures in all versions of those projects.","tags":null,"title":"GodExpo: an automated god structure detection tool for Golang","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
