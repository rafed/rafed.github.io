## How to think like a baby

<img class="pic" alt="Imagination" src="/img/blog/imagination.png">

I am always thinking about random stuff. My mind starts off at one point and ends somewhere else completely different. One day, I decided to track how my mind works and I realized something that I hadn't noticed before. I always think using words and sentences. It's the only way my mind can work. Whatever I look at, whatever I do, my mind thinks about it using some sort of spoken language.

To make sure I wasn't the only one, I asked some of my friends to find out if was the same for them as well. Without any surprise, they all said that their mind thought with a language.

So, if we always think with the help of a language, how does the mind of a baby work? Surely a baby has no concept of a language. So I decided to try it out, thinking without a language.

I sat down on my desk and began to empty my mind. It was difficult at first because the words somehow barged in out of nowhere. After a few minutes, it became easier, although one or two words eventually broke in. What I felt next was something very different and special.

For the first time in many years, I had a different perception of the things around me. I started to notice the details in my surroundings. Previously, the wall in front of me was just a wall, the water bottle I drink from was just a bottle. But now they looked different, they had something more in them. I saw colors and textures. The color of the wall was white and I saw the roughness on it. I saw the small dents on my plastic water bottle which I hadn't noticed before. I saw the dust on my table, the light reflecting from a shiny surface, the deep mark of my handwriting (which isn't very nice really) on the backside of a page.

I picked up my pen, smartphone, and other random stuff. They were nothing different from each other. They were all just _objects_ of different sizes, shapes, and colors. I don't know what each of them does (at least :stuck_out_tongue: I'm trying to think that I don't know), I just see the incredible details on them. The pen at one point looked like a rocket, and I even played rocket for a while (no :expressionless: don't laugh at me). 

Even my senses became sharper. I could hear the fan above my head, the birds chirping outside and the sound of my own fidgeting leg. I'm sure if I changed location, I would notice a change in smell as well.

Here is what I interpret from this experiment. As we grow up, we tend to abstract the things around us. A "pointy thing, which is orange in color, has a detachable thingy which has a tinier hole on it" is a "we write with it" thing for us adults. Although this abstraction hides details, it achieves two important things- keeps our mind less occupied and better connects the thing around us. This helps us think at a higher level and map a better relation among objects.

For kids, this is an incredible power of observation. Why does a kid learn so much faster than an adult? Because their mind is empty, it does not know much. Whatever you'll say the kid will observe with utmost interest (unless :stuck_out_tongue: he is focused somewhere else). He will observe every detail. Maybe this doesn't give a better overview of the world, but it definitely gives you an upper hand in learning. 

And this is the sole reason why kids have so much more imagination. They have this perception so different from us. They can transform one object to something completely else in their mind. This is the source of their creativity.

So, my point is, if you want to boost your creativity, think like a baby. And if you want to think like a baby, think without a language. Leave a comment below whether you like or dislike my reasoning.

This article is not based on any scientific study. It is simply my own view. I would definitely like you to try this "thinking without words" experiment. Let me know about your experiences below!
