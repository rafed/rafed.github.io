## Karate

Karate is an unarmed martial art discipline that involves kicking, striking, and defensive blocking. It is practiced as an art (budo), self-defense or as a sport. 

Originating from **Japan**, Karate was founded by **Gichin Funakoshi** in **1902**. Karate means **empty hand**. Although most techniques are empty handed, occasionally weapons are also practiced. A Karate practitioner is called a **Karateka**. Famous practitioners include **Jean-Claude Van Damme, Luca Valdesi, Bill (superfoot) Wallace**.

### History

There are no formal records of the early roots of karate. Different fighting techniques were practiced in the Ryukyu islands of Japan and it is assumed that these techniques were influenced by Chinese martial arts (Kung fu). With time, some Ryukyuan families moved to Okinawa and the fighting systems started to spread. In 1609, there was an invasion of Okinawa and its inhabitants were banned from owning any sort of weapons or practice fighting techniques. This directly impacted the development of Karate.

In 1875, Okinawa officially became a part of Japan and the ban was lifted. Soon the art started to spread across Japan. And finally, in 1902, Gichin Funakoshi gave Karate its official form. And from there, Karate started to spread very quickly around the world.

### Styles

Although Gichin Funakoshi is credited to be the founder of Karate, there were many other practitioners who taught Karate in their own flavor. This gave rise to different dialects of Karate. Only four styles of Karate are officially recognized by The World Karate Federation (WKF). There are more than 10 other unofficial styles that exist.

#### Official styles

Styles recognized by WKF-

1. Shotokan
2. Goju-Ryu
3. Shito-Ryu
4. Wado-Ryu

Shotokan is the most popular style of Karate (founded by Gichin Funakoshi).

#### Unofficial styles

### Practice

A Karate practice place is called **Dojo**. There are two main aspects of Karate- **Kata** and **Kumite**. **Kata** literally means "shape" or "model." Basically, it is a formalized sequence of movements which represent various offensive and defensive postures. It can be performed alone or in groups.

### Ranking

Karate students wear belts of different colors (called **Obi**) which determine their rank. The belt system in Karate is adopted from Judo. There are 10 levels of colored belts (**Kyu**) and 10 levels of black belts (**Dan**). To get promoted to the next rank, a student has to acquire a certain skill level and pass an exam. The exams are usually taken in an interval of 3-4 months.

White - 10th Kyu  
<span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> - 9th Kyu  
<span style="color:orange">Orange</span> - 8th Kyu  
<span style="color:red">Red</span> - 7th Kyu  
<span style="color:green">Green</span> - 6th Kyu  
<span style="color:purple">Purple</span> - 5th Kyu  
<span style="color:blue">Blue</span> - 4th Kyu  
<span style="color:brown">Brown</span>(1) - 3rd Kyu  
<span style="color:brown">Brown</span>(2) - 2nd Kyu  
<span style="color:brown">Brown</span>(3) - 1st Kyu  
Black - 1st Dan to 10th Dan

Not all dojos follow the exact ranking. Some dojos may add or omit some colored belts.

### Personal opinion

Karate is the most natural martial art. What I mean by natural is that there are arts, that have stances, punches, and kicks that are odd looking or does not come naturally. In Karate, the movements, strikes, and kicks are pretty simple and come very naturally and intuitively.

Karate is also a very well rounded martial art. It focuses on every part of the body equally. Taekwondo focuses mostly on legs, and Judo is all about throws. There is nothing like this in Karate. Punches, kicks, throws and all other aspects have equal value. 

Although Karate emerged out of the need of fighting in practical situations its effectiveness is decreasing day by day. That's because it has become more of a sport than an art of fighting. If you want to learn self-defense then Karate will not be worth the effort. Of course, this has exceptions and there are some gyms will that will truly teach self-defense. But in most places, you will be taught how effectively you should punch to get a point.

Despite questioning its effectiveness, Karate is a very beautiful and fun art to learn. There is no reason why one should not enjoy Karate. It is very easy and beginner friendly. The learning curve, in the beginning, is not so steep as other martial arts. If you want to learn a martial art for fun or physical exercise, you can definitely consider Karate.

That's all about Karate. Now, let's go to learn more about [Judo](judo)!
