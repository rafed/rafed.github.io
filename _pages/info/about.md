# About me

Hi. I am Rafed, just another ordinary guy trying out different things. I am interested in learning new things. I learnt music and singing and now I play the piano. After that I studied different martial arts of the world and practised Judo and Karate. And now I am trying to be a geek, studying software engineering.

I built this site just to share my personal experiences and things that I've learnt over the years. Hope it will be of help to somebody in the world!

If you would like to know more about me, go [here](/profile).
