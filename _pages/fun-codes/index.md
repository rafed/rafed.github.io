## Fun codes

<img class="pic" alt="Programming caution" src="/img/fun-codes/caution.png">

As a software engineering student, I always have to write codes (whether I like it or not :stuck_out_tongue:) Amongst the boring codes I write there also happen to be some fun and interesting ones as well. All these fun codes and no one to see? NO! So I finally decided to share them with you!

I have tried my best to give the best possible demo. The source code of all the projects are hosted on my [github account](https://github.com/rafed123) and I have provided direct links to them. The source codes are completely free. You can use and modify them to your will.

There is no single reason for why I did each project. Most of my reasons to write are-
- Class assignments
- Group projects
- Something that came up in mind
- Gotta learn this stuff!

Feel free to comment on projects in the comment section. Hope you enjoy!!!
