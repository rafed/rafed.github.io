# About this blog

Back when I was a kid, I once turned the tv on to History channel. A program called 'Human Weapon' was being broadcasted at that time. Since then my life changed. Martial arts suddenly got into my blood. I gradually tried to understand the philosophy, techniques and styles of different martial arts around the globe. I personally practised judo, karate and taekwondo. There is no martial art that has failed to amuse me. This blog is just a small effort to share what I have learnt over the years. Most of it is my personal opinion, so it is ok if you do not agree with me in some places.

## What does martial art mean

**Martial** means **relating to war**, and of course you know what **art** means. Together it means the art of fighting. Mind you, its not the science of fighting. Many people argue regarding which martial art is the best. The thing is, you cannot judge one art to be superior or inferior to another. It is completely a matter of choice. Different martial arts had different reasons of originating. You can of course measure which martial artist is better, but you cannot say the same about the art they practice.

## Origin of the arts

The roots of most traditional martial arts difficult to trace. Many techniques are practised for a long time until someone decides, "Hey, lets make these techniques a collection and call it something fancy." And tada! A new martial art was found.

And then there were some guys who said, "Hey, lets take all the good stuff from the good martial arts and call it something more fancy." And tada! A **hybrid martial art** was made. Like, Chuck Norris made **Chun Kuk Do** taking stuff from **Tang Soo Do** and several other styles. Bruce Lee made **Jeet Kune Do** mixing **Wing Chun**, **Boxing** and several other arts.

## Types of martial arts

Martial arts are classified in mainly two types:
* **Soft styles:** It is based upon throws, grappling and locks. It lacks punching and kicking. Arts in this category are **Judo** and **Aikido**.
* **Hard styles:** It is based on punching and kicking, and also most of the times include some throwing and locking. **Karate, Taekwondo, Krav Maga** are some hard styles.

## Martial arts and philosophy

Most martial arts have a vision of their own, specially the eastern martial arts. Apart from teaching to fight, they also teach purpose of life, medicines, bone setting and spirituality. In fact, eastern martial arts are seen as more of a lifestyle. If you see their names you will find one thing in common. Karate-**do**, Ju**do**, Taekwo**do**, Aiki**do**, they all have "_do_" in common. Do means lifestyle. These martial arts not only taught people how to fight, they taught them how to live.
