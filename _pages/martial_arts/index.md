# The human weapon

Since the ancient times people have dueled and engaged in war. For such combats they deviced techniques to take leverage over their opponents. And thus martial arts were born. But not all martial arts were designed to fight. Some were made to discover the wonders of the human body. Now, whether they were designed to kill or understand more of the human body, I will take you on a tour to some of the renowned martial arts on the planet.

But at first, lets get down to the basics.

## The meaning of _martial art_

**Martial** means **relating to war**, and I am pretty sure you know what **art** means. Together it means the art of fighting. Mind you, its not the science of fighting. There are literally thousands of martial arts around the world. Many people pointlessly argue regarding which martial art is the best. The thing is, you cannot judge one art to be superior or inferior to another. It is completely a matter of choice. Different martial arts had different reasons of originating. You can of course measure which martial artist is better, but you cannot say the same about the art they practice.

## How they originated

The roots of most traditional martial arts difficult to trace. Many techniques are practiced for a long time until someone decides, "Hey, lets make these techniques a collection and call it something fancy." And tada! A new martial art is found.

And then there were some guys who said, "Hey, lets take all the good stuff from the good martial arts and call it something more fancy." And tada! A **hybrid martial art** is made. Like, Chuck Norris made **Chun Kuk Do** taking stuff from **Tang Soo Do** and several other styles. Bruce Lee made **Jeet Kune Do** mixing **Wing Chun**, **Boxing** and several other arts.

## Martial arts and philosophy

Most martial arts have a vision of their own, specially the eastern martial arts. Apart from teaching to fight, they also teach purpose of life, medicines, bone setting and spirituality. In fact, eastern martial arts are seen as more of a lifestyle. If you see their names you will find one thing in common. Karate-**do**, Ju**do**, Taekwo**do**, Aiki**do**, they all have "_do_" in common. **Do** means lifestyle. These martial arts not only taught people how to fight, they taught them how to live. 

## Types of martial arts

Martial arts are classified in mainly two types:
* **Soft styles:** It is based upon throws, grappling and locks. It lacks punching and kicking. Arts in this category are **Judo** and **Aikido**.
* **Hard styles:** It is based on punching and kicking, and also most of the times include some throwing and locking. **Karate, Taekwondo, Krav Maga** are some hard styles.

## Styles

A martial art may have different styles. Think of it like this, English is spoken in USA, UK and Australia. Although the language is same, the pronunciation in each country is different. This happens to martial arts as well. For example **Karate** is a martial art, but it has several styles- **Shotokan, Kyokushin, Goju ryu**. Although they may seem similar at first, there are slight differences.
