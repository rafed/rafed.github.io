# Fighter me

I have a strange love for martial arts. I studied about different martial arts around the world. I have also written a series on it. You can check it out [here](/martial_arts/index.html). I wanted to learn taekwondo but a taekwondo gym nearby was not available. So I started learning Karate and Judo under Sensei Shamser Alam in DUJKC (Dhaka University Judo and Karate Center). I am in green belt currently. My rank would have been higher had I not missed belt exams which coincided with my college and varsity routines.

In 2015, I got two bronze medals. One in the 3rd inter hall karate competition. Another one in the 3rd inter hall Judo competition. Both of them were in the "under 60 kg" weight category.
