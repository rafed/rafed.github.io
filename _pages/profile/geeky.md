## Geeky me

I have an interest in pentesting. In my free time I often read blogs written by professional pentesters on how they found a flaw in a system. Although I major in software engineering I look forward to get recognition as a penetration tester. I am still a beginner but I am hopeful that I will contribute to bug bounty programs one day.
