## Musician me

I showed musical talent at a very young age! My first income came from singing at a radio station when I was little. At the age of 7, I started taking lessons under Pradip Kumar Das. Under him I learnt various, Rabindra Sangit (Tagore songs), Nazrul Geeti and folk songs. Several years later I started going to Chayanaut. But sadly I couldnt graduate as I had to drop out because going to chayanaut became difficult.

Some years later I felt interested in learning the piano. I bought an electrical keyboard and started learning from the internet. It was not so difficult for me as I had prior experience with the harmonium.

Although I have no intentions to become a professional musician, I do love to record songs and music. Here is my first official music video!

I have more interest in instrumentals and music scores than songs. I love eastern classical music and western classical music. Currently I am trying to learn a little bit of staff notations so that I can read music.
