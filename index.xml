      <description>Music Music has been a part of my life for a very long time. I studied singing in Chayanaut for a few years. Later, I picked up the keyboard and it has been about 10 years since I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing the keyboard. I was offered to play in bands but I declined and kept playing limited to a hobby for myself. However, I did play and sing in events of my department.</description>

      <description>Skills I&amp;rsquo;d tell most people that I&amp;rsquo;m a backend engineer. However, I like to see the big picture of things and that&amp;rsquo;s why I spend most of my time in learning other skills such as cloud, devops, machine learning.
Backend  Python: Nearly all my projects are done in python. I&amp;rsquo;m good with Flask and currently learning Django. Go: I&amp;rsquo;m learning how to make scalable applications using Go. Dotnet core: Not an expert, but can get the job done.</description>
