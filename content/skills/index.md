I believe in tool-agnostic skills. Being in an industry that moves at the speed of time, it sometimes doesn't matter what tools/frameworks I'm familiar with. Because frameworks are so fickle these days that they can become obsolete within months! What matters more is how fast can I learn and make myself comfortable with newer technology. I believe I'm a quick learner.

In an interview, I'd say that I'm a backend engineer. However, I consider myself a generalist. I like to see the big picture of things and try to learn a bit of everything.  That's why I spend a significant amount of time in learning skills related to cloud, devops, machine-learning and front-end frameworks.

## Backend

- **Python:** Nearly all my projects are done in python. I'm good with Flask and currently learning Django.
- **Go:** I'm learning how to make scalable applications using Go.
- **Node.js:** Can write simple apps.
- **Dotnet core:** Not an expert, but can get the job done.
- **Databases:** MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB.

## Frontend

I'm not a front end dev and don't expect me to be one. But I do have some tricks up my sleeve. 

- **Vue:** I love this framework .
- **Angular:** Not my favorite, but can get the job done.
- **Flutter:** Don't know this yet but I'm considering it for learning.

## Cloud

- **Docker:** Can containerize applications, run dockerized containers, setting up clusters with docker-compose.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** I can setup VPSes and know how other GCP services can be used.

## Network & Security

I have spent a decent amount of time in learning security concepts, how to exploit, and how to fix them. These concepts also provided gave me a decent knowledge of networking. I've spent several years using Kali Linux as my main OS just to practice a bit now and then. Among the vast number of tools, some of the popular ones I can use are:
- BurpSuite
- SQLmap
- Bettercap
- Wireshark
- nmap
- Metasploit

## Machine learning

I have spent a good time using the following tools for building models and data analysis:

- Scikit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Keras
