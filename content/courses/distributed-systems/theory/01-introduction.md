A distributed system is a computing environment in which **various components** are spread across **multiple computers** (or other computing devices) on **a network**.

If one machine can do a task in 1 hr, surely two equivalent machines can do it in 30 mins.

We gain some sort of advantage that

Examples of distributed systems

1. Machine learning (for compute)
1. P2P file sharing (high availability, share large files, piracy)
1. Google search engine (for storage and bandwidth)
1. Facebook (for storage and bandwidth)
1. Multiplayer games (entertainment)
1. Space rockets (correctness)
    spaceX dragon
1. Black hole image (distributed observation)
1. IOT (Sensors on a network)
1. Blockchain
    decentralized record of transactions
    guarantees the fidelity and security of a record
