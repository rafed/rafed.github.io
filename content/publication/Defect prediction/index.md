abstract: Defect prediction is one of the most popular research topics due to its potentiality to minimize software quality assurance effort. Existing approaches have examined defect prediction from various perspective such as complexity and developer metrics. However, none of these consider programming style for defect prediction. This paper aims at analyzing the impact of stylistic metrics on both within-project and cross-project defect prediction. For prediction, 4 widely used machine learning algorithms namely Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression are used. The experiment is conducted on 14 releases of 5 popular, open source projects. F1, Precision and Recall are inspected to evaluate the results. Results reveal that stylistic metrics are good predictor of defects.
