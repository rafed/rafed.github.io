abstract: Program comprehension is one of the most important activities in developing and maintaining software. Although existing studies have examined aspects of Go such as design patterns, code smells and comment density, the comprehensibility of Go has not been explored yet. This study analyzes the comprehensibility of Go by comparing it with Java based on five metrics namely Too Long Files, Too Long Methods, Nesting Depth, Lack of Cohesive Comments and Duplicate Comments. For comparison, 50 popular, diverse and open-source projects are selected from each language. Results show that Go projects outperform Java in terms of Nesting Depth, Lack of Cohesive Comments and Duplicate Comments.
