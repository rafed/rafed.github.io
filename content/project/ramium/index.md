After discovering Hugo (a static blog generator), I decided to make a theme for myself and Ramium was the result.

Not really the best theme out there, but hey, it was a nice learning experience.

I have made a better theme now called BlogRa, which I use for my personal tech blog. Check it out at [github.com/rafed/BlogRa](https://github.com/rafed/BlogRa)
