Hello, it's Rafed!

I'm bored, hire me for software development or research work. If you're bored then consider reading my blog at [rafed.github.io/devra/](https://rafed.github.io/devra/)

Dabbling into experimental cutting edge new technologies is my favorite pastime. Check out the rest of my portfolio to know my powers and skills.
