I've been learning music since I was very small. For more than 7 years, I was home schooled in Indian classical, folk music, Rabindra Sangit, and Nazrul Geeti. Later, I joined Chayanaut, but I couldn't stick with it for too long because life happened. Now I have an electric keyboard and practice the piano from time to time.
