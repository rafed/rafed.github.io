I've been learning music from a young age. I was home schooled in Rabindra Sangit, Nazrul geeti, Folk music and Indian Classical for over 7 years. I later joined chayanaut but couldnt continue long because... you know, life happened. Now I have an electric keyboard and practice playing the piano. Check out my youtube channel [Rafulu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm06Y0e-rYROhZ76-GLtYTQ).
