I'm trying to learn as many languages as I can. I'm confident I can do this if I can learn a new programming language or framework every other day. Here is my to-do list for languages. I'm actively utilizing Duolingo and other online resources to achieve this.

- [x] Bangla
- [x] English
- [x] Hindi
- [x] Arabic
- [ ] Turkish
- [ ] Spanish
- [ ] Japanese
- [ ] Korean
- [ ] Chinese
- [ ] Russian
