I've been a big fan of martial arts. I actively learned Judo and Karate from a Dojo. Additionally I've tried self learning techniques of other martial arts such as Tae Kwon Do, Boxing, etc. Finding time for practicing nowadays have now become difficult. However, I still dream of going back to a dojo, break my sweat, and spar again.
