I'm a big martial arts fan. I actively learned Judo and Karate in the past. Additionally I've tried to self teach myself techniques of other martial arts such as Tae Kwon Do, Boxing, etc. Finding time for practicing nowadays have become difficult. However, I still dream of going back to the dojo, break my sweat, and spar again.
