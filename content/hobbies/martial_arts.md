I'm a huge fan of martial arts. I have practiced Judo and Karate in the past. Additionally, I've attempted to teach myself the fundamentals of various martial arts, such Tae Kwon Do, boxing, etc. Nowadays, finding time to practice has become challenging. I still dream of returning to the dojo to spar and fight again.
